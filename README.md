# Roku-GooglePhotos

History of this channel:

  - Roku-Picasa v.1.0 was derived from Chris Hoffman's Picasa Channel (https://github.com/chrishoffman/roku-picasa)
  - Roku-Picasa v.2.0 was forked by Belltown to incorporate Google's OAuth2 credential support
  - Roku-GooglePhotos v.3.0 was forked by Chris Taylor to add a number of functionality improvements and new Google API support.
     - v.3.0 also rebranded Picasa to Google Photos. Google (which owned Picasa) decided to push Google Photos and stop supporting Picasa
     - For now, the old Picasa API's continue to function, just in a limited fashion. It is our hope they continue to support these APIs!
  - (CURRENT) Officially dumbed v.4.0, this new release will replace the legacy Roku screens in with SceneGraphs. Roku will be discontinuing support in 2018 for all legacy components. This is a major update and will be worked out of a feature branch to allow updates to continue to v.3.0.
